<h1>Yantramattan</h1>
<h3>What is Yantramattan?</h3>
<p>Yantramattan is an acupressure mat. Itâ€™s is simply a mat with stimulation points, where you lay on. 
It has its origin in the ancient Chinese medicine. It has been of big help to me with my neck pain. 
I have many times experienced intense muscle pain, not being able to move my head to one side. These 
conditions where occurring often to me, and lasted from 4 to 7 days. When I started using the Yantramattan 
my neck was pain free within 2-3 days! It can also be used for pain or tension relief on your back or shoulders,
 as a headache relief, stress relief, energy booster and sleep improvement. 
</p> 

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<p>There are many ways of using the Yantramattan.
The most popular is laying on your back. You can also lay on 
<br>
your belly,
<br>
on your side or 
<br>
<em>even</em> <strong>stand</strong> <u>on</u> it.
